Wish List)
- How do i know if Im in "real mode"
- How do PS2 and USB interop?
- Need .config file
- Actually pass processer state to irqs
- implement + test isr exceptions 0-31
- Implement the color modes beyond text mode for VGA driver
- Have user space code actually run in usr space

Actually need todo to move forward)
- Every module needs to call the register module
- Once scheduler is figured out re-org, doc, and clean
   - IRQ code is coming more and more central since this is event driven
   - IRQ code should be cleaned up and set standard for all modules
   - Like wise with the scheduler
   - Have API more distinct and well defined.
   - Need to organize shit better
   - PCI driver
   - SHould seperate out public apis that drivers export to user space
   - DOC!!!
   - unified error handling
   - Add warning output when bad shit happens
- Ways of measuring performance i.e. clock cycles
- Network driver
- CPU idle
- Locks / other sync primitives
- mmu / tlb and address translation??

Scheduler)
- actually implement the calling user space code
- don't allow pubs unless there is a sub
- ensure buffers are cleared with each interrupt invocation
- schduler should track interrupt context depth
